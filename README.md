### Code Implementation Example

Let's start with creating agents and tasks:

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import GoogleAdManagerTool, DataAnalysisTool, ContentWritingTool, ClientManagementTool

# Define Tools (Example placeholders)
google_ad_manager_tool = GoogleAdManagerTool()
data_analysis_tool = DataAnalysisTool()
content_writing_tool = ContentWritingTool()
client_management_tool = ClientManagementTool()
